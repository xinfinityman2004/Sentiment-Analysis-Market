## üìå Key Features  
- **Competitor Analysis Framework**: Automated sentiment scoring (-1 to 1) for Amazon video game reviews  
- **Multi-Method Sentiment Analysis**:  
  - Dictionary-based scoring (NLTK Vader)  
  - Deep Learning approach using DistilBERT (Transformers)  
- **Bias Mitigation**: Advanced sampling techniques for imbalanced datasets  
- **Actionable Reporting**: Interactive Altair visualizations of linguistic patterns in positive/negative reviews
